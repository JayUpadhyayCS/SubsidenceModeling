## Overview
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in groundwater pumping in the Central Valley area. This area is known as an agricultural hub that now suffers from land subsidence due to the excess pumping of groundwater. NASA JPL has been tracking the land deformation from 2014 to 2019. We were given snapshots of data for every two weeks within the five year period. The data provided to us includes longitude, latitude, displacement, and precipitation of the Central Valley region. With this data, our goal is to analyze the data and create animated heatmaps and graphs that show changes over time. We want to show the relationship between all the facts and clearly show the effect of groundwater pumping on land subsidence. All the maps, graphs, and animations will be added to a local website that will display the dashboard.
